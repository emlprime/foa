  <p>F.O. Apparel is what happens when you combine a childhood of drawing and a Bachelor's degree in Biology with a love for clothing.  Also a sick sense of humor and absolutely no internal filter.</p>
  <p>The name F.O. Apparel is named after the first designs I made.  If your parents ask what it stands for, make something up.  Especially if you're one of my siblings.</p>
